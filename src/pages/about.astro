          jpc.finance was created with a simple mission: to empower individuals
          with the tools and insights they need to take control of their
          financial future. We believe that financial freedom should be
          accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford expensive
          advisors or complex software.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Our platform provides intuitive, powerful tools for budgeting,
          investment tracking, and financial planning - all designed to help you
          make informed decisions about your money.
